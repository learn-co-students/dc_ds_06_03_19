### Open the CO2 notebook we have worked on 

##### The goal is to use the month and year attributes/features as a categorical variable to use in multiple regression
- Do you understand why it's problematic to leave it as an integer type ? 

### 1. load the co2 data 

### 2. follow all steps from previous notebook to get it to the state where we have 4 columns (year, month, day, CO2)


### 3. Transform month and year to categorical variables 

`Use pd.dummy`

### 4. For practice purposes only let's create a function that gets a df and a column name and outputs a normalized column
 - a column of our choice --> here we'll test the CO2 column 
`use the np.mean function and np.std `
 
### 5. push all your changes to github

### 6. open the suicide_rates file and notebook 

### 7. apply normalization and dummies wherever seems appropriate to you to prepare the data for some analysis - this is a discussion to be done in pairs or triplets.

### 8. push any changes to github

### 9. Send your TCF the last value of normalized C02 you have recieved
