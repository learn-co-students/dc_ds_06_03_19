    "## Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "A toy picture of science has it that the scientist formulates a hypothesis that explains or generalizes from some set of observations, and then conducts some experiment, which will either confirm or refute that hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is an oversimplification of good practice. Consider the possibility that the experiment yield statistically improbable results. In that case it may well be a mistake to generalize from those results or to reject an hypothesis that doesn't predict them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the confirmation of some testing or **alternative hypothesis, $H_\\alpha$**, is a _relative_ affair, where it is measured against some **null hypothesis, $H_0$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an alternative hypothesis states that there is some significant relationship between two variables, then the null hypothesis simply states that there is no such relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're testing the function of a new drug, then the null hypothesis will say that the drug has _no effect_ on patients, or anyway no effect relative to relief of the malady the drug was designed to combat. If we're testing whether Peeps cause dementia, then the null hypothesis will say that there is _no correlation_ between Peeps consumption and rate of dementia development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## $p$-Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of a p-value is to quantify the probability that the results seen are in fact the result of mere random chance. This is connected with the null hypothesis since, if the null hypothesis is true and there is no significant correlation between the population variables X and Y, then of course any correlation between X and Y observed in our sample would have to be the result of mere random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Unlikely Is Too Unlikely?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we calculate a p-value for some statistic we've measured (more on this below!) and we get a p-value of 20%. This would mean that there is a 20% chance that the results we observed were the result of mere random chance. Probably this is high enough that we ought _not_ to reject the null hypothesis that our variables are uncorrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a p-value _threshold_ of 5% is very often the default value for these tests of statistical significance. Thus, if it is calculated that the chance that the results we observed were actually the result of randomness is less than 1 in 20, then we would _reject_ the null hypothesis and _accept_ the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work with the normal distribution, since it's so useful. Suppose we are told that African elephants have weights distributed normally around a mean of 9000 lbs., with a standard deviation of 900 lbs. Pachyderm Adventures has recently measured the weights of 25 African elephants in Gabon and has calculated their average weight at 8637 lbs. They claim that these statistics on the Gabonese elephants are significant. Let's find out!\n",

Given that the null hypothesis is false, we ought to expect to see a correlation between those who took Hepomanol and those who experienced relief of symptoms. But the probability that we might, by random chance, see _no_ correlation is higher for smaller sample sizes. The more patients we test, the more likely we are to observe the actually existing correlation. Thus, all else equal, tests involving larger samples will have higher degrees of power.\n",
