Ideally, these are \"honest\" forecasts, however, if you test a great number of models and choose the model whose errors are smallest in the validation period, you may end up overfitting the data within the validation period as well as in the estimation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forecasts into the future** are \"true\" forecasts that are made for time periods beyond the end of the available data. For a model which is purely extrapolative in nature , it is possible to extend the forecasts an arbitrary number of periods into the future by \"bootstrapping\" the model: first a one-period-ahead forecast is made, then the one-period-ahead forecast is treated as a data point and the model is cranked ahead to produce a two-period-ahead forecast, and so on as far as you wish."
