    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last lab, we will implement a a movie recommendation system using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) in Spark programming environment.<br> Spark's machine learning libraray `ml` comes packaged with a very efficient imeplementation of ALS algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lab will require you to put into pratice your spark programming skills for creating and manipulating pyspark DataFrames. We will go through a step-by-step process into developing a movie recommendation system using ALS and pyspark using the MovieLens Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You are advised to refer to [PySpark Documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/index.html) heavily for completing this lab as it will introduce a few new methods. "

For Netflix service, 75% of movies that people watch are based on some sort of recommendation.\n",

    "### We sort of get the concept\n",
    "\n",
    "For online video content services like Netflix and Hulu, the need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important. An example of recommendation system is such as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    User A watches Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.\n",
    "2.    User B performs a search query for Game of Thrones.\n",
    "3.    The system suggests Breaking Bad to user B from data collected about user A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will guide you through a step-by-step process into developing such a movie recommendation system. We will use the MovieLens dataset to build a movie recommendation system using the collaborative filtering technique with Spark's Alternating Least Saqures implementation. After building that recommendation system, we will go through the process of adding a new user to the dataset with some new ratings and obtaining new recommendations for that user."
